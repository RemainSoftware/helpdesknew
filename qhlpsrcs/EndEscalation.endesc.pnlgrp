Escalation end

:P.
The End Escalation Command is used to end the escalation. This process
is described below.

:P.
You can stop the escalation jobs by using the option 2 of the
HelpDesk Escalation Menu, by using the ENDESC (End Escalation)
command, or by one of the following commands: ENDJOB, ENDSBS,
ENDSYS or PWRDWNSYS, in all cases with the *CNTRLD option and a
delay time of at least 30 seconds. The batchjob that activates
the escalation jobs checks every 15 seconds whether an end request
has been made, also during processing, and, if so, the escalation
jobs are ending in a controlled way.

:P.
If you want to use the escalation function of the HelpDesk, it is
recommended to schedule the batchjob as well as the ENDESC function
in your systems starting and closing procedures.
